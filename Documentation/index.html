<h1>Introduction to SimpleSprite</h1>
<p>
SimpleSprite is a C++ framework based on <a href="www.libsdl.org">SDL</a> and <a
href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a> that you can use to create games,
screensavers, demos, presentations, etc. Like other sprite engines it allows you
to load and animate bitmap graphics, test collisions between objects, and assign
atomic behaviors to game objects. The only requirement is a little patience and
some knowledge of C++.
</p>
<p>
SimpleSprite was originally inspired by <a
href="http://www.spriteworld.org/">SpriteWorld</a>, a library written in C and
C++ for Mac OS, and used in games like Escape Velocity. I didn't set out to copy
SpriteWorld but rather to implement its best features - such as sprite layers
and action procs - and to extend these concepts with the power of OpenGL. The
result is a clean, lightweight, and flexible class library which resembles many
other sprite libraries.
</p>
<p>
It is not necessary to subclass most SimpleSprite classes to customize them
because many base classes implement their virtual methods as procedure
callbacks. This is useful mainly for prototyping. For more complex games it's
far better to implement everything as subclasses.
</p>
<p>
This game library is continuing to expand as I build projects with it. I have
not yet created a finished game with SimpleSprite but I have created fully
working environments with interacting AIs. It all works very simply, according
to the same principles set forth in many other sprite libraries. The main
purpose of this project is to take the 2D sprite concept to the next level
through the power of OpenGL.
</p>
<p>
I consider C++ as the ideal language for this purpose because it is available on
all platforms and every serious game programmer knows it. SDL is also ideal for
its ubiquity. SimpleSprite has been tested and compiled in XCode on Mac OS X and
Visual Studio in Windows 2000. Theoretically it should compile well on any
system supporting gcc.

		SimpleSprite Features

-->

<div id="methbox">
<h1>Features Overview</h1>

<dl>

<dt>Image and Texture support</dt>
<dd>SimpleSprite can load image files in GIF, JPEG, BMP, and PNG
formats. PNG is favored for its amazing powers of translucency.
The SDL_image library provides all this power for free.</dd>

<dt>Fonts, strings, and blocks of text</dt>
<dd>An SFont file is an image file in any format containing the font and
a line of markers at the top. (Samples should be included.) Your fonts
can be used in their own layers or inside user interface objects.</dd>


<dt>Tiles and tile maps</dt>
<dd>A Tile Palette file is an image file in any format containing a grid
of tiles of any regular size. Tile maps are large multi-layered
environments that integrate seamlessly into nearly endless scrolling
worlds. Sprites can interact with tile maps to test collisions or
pick up objects on the map.</dd>


<dt>User Interface and Event Chain</dt>
<dd>The SS_GUI and SS_Gadget classes are the SimpleSprite equivalent of
windows and controls. A GUI is a special layer for gadgets which
implements an event chain. Simple controls like buttons, checkboxes, sliders,
and edit fields are already provided.</dd>


<dt>Sound Effects and Music</dt>
<dd>You can load and play AIFF, WAV, and MP3 files with the SS_Sound and
SS_Music classes. These classes utilize the SDL_mixer and smpeg libraries
and playback performance is very good.</dd>


<dt>Inter-Object Messaging</dt>
<dd>Objects can easily send messages to one another with the SS_Broadcaster
and SS_Listener classes. Worlds, Layers, LayerItems, GUIs, and Gadgets
already inherit from these classes, so virtually any object in your
game can register to listen to any other object.</dd>


<dt>Distributed AI</dt>
<dd>Every sprite and game object has hooks for procedures that define its
behavior. This provides discreet intelligence for simple behaviors like
spinning, pursuit, gravitation, flashing, animation, etc. You can use
Finite State Machine technology to generate more complex behaviors and
decision-making. AI Stacks make it easy to jump in and out of states as
required. This means your creatures can take detours from a current task
and return to it later when the detour is completed.</dd>
<dd>Finite State Machines are very fast, so you can have thousands of concurrent
decision trees evolving simultaneously.</dd>
